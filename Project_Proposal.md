Project Proposal

Introduction
We are creating a 2d flying object (Plane, UFO, etc.) game where you control the flying object to pass over buildings in order it to survive. The flying object will run automatically. The player will have to get the best score by surviving the buildings and airports. Some graphics will be taken from other games.

Functional Requirements

1.	Menu (start, options, quit)

2.	Different characters
      a.	Different abilities/speeds
3.	High score list

4.	Game modes (regular, endless)

5.	Items/Powerups
      a.	Missiles
      b.	Invulnerability (Still deciding)
      c.	Shield (Still deciding)
      d.	Weapon (Still deciding)

6.Interactive Environment
      a.	Some obstacles can be broken
      b.	Moving platforms

7.Music/sounds
      a.	The sound will be from the flying object either an airplane sound or a UFO sound or any other object. 

Non-Functional Requirements
Not too cpu-heavy
Programmed in Java
•	Kept up to date with future versions
30 Fps

System Evolution
•	Will use the latest java program. The later ones won’t work.

Glossary
•	SideScroller - a video game in which the gameplay action is viewed from a side-view camera angle, and the onscreen flying object will generally move from the left side of the screen to the right to meet an objective.
•	Fps - frames per second
•	Powerup - objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character. (Still Deciding)

Comments:
	Some of the stuff we still are deciding. It depends on our knowledge of if we can code this. Will defiantly let you guys in loop of what we have done so far.
